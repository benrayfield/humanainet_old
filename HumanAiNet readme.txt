We are going to teach eachother how to build AI and new kinds of game objects in this network using intuitive dragAndDrop. Its going to be a space for experimenting with fun and useful tools in new ways. Version 0.8.0 has some advanced components that will be working soon. The plan is a massively multiplayer space where we design, evolve, and play with game objects and do AI research together which controls those game objects along with directly playing the games. The main data format is, from xorlisp which is also in progress, immutable binary forest nodes, so if millions of people build that together nobody can damage or change anyone else's data since its all constant. You dont change variables. You create new data that points at existing constant data, as deep as you need it. I have mindmap lists, definitions, and 2 editable properties working that way with 2 kinds of event listeners that work locally. Its not a networked system yet, but the datastructs are ready to scale with it.
