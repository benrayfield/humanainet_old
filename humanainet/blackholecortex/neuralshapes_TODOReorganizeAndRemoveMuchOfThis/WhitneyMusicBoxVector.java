/** A scalar which is represented as angle around many circles each a different frequency,
of an array of such frequencies. For example: Frequencies 5-30 would be 26 nodes
which are observed to bits after their influence/neuralActivation is .5+.5*sine(angle).
The purpose is a representation of scalar numbers thats compatible with boltzmann machines,
so the scalar can be rebuilt from those bits statistically or the bits generate
the scalar statistically, similar to fourier but might have a problem getting it accurate.
