/** network grid, the part of my mind I imagine as many small balls or pictures
with lines between them, and the balls can move around as I look at them in combinations.
Its been very useful in understanding AI network shapes. I use this grid in my mind to,
first think about sigmoid and specific brightness/weights between certain dots,
then imprint it onto other parts of my mind in combinations, so the network grid
can expand to more dots and more lines that way, temporarily but the more you do
it the more a stable pattern in the mind it becomes.

TODO many Thing (as points in the simplest case) with lines between them,
and the lines can have any kind of data between them but normally are
arrows or undirected lines. The more complex kinds are not actually stored
in the NetworkGrid but imprint on FlatXYP or PolarEye to imagine what
the network grid would look like, then imprint it onto other parts of itself,
so the same lines are imprinted by multiple node pairs and edge between them,
for example, to compare the edges between different pairs of nodes.
