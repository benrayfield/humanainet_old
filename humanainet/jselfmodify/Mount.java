/** Ben F Rayfield offers JSelfModify under Apache 2, GNU LGPL, and/or Classpath Exception.
Open-source licenses are best understood with set-theory: Subsets, supersets,
and intersections of the legal permissions each license grants.
Example: If JSelfModify is combined with only the parts of HumanAINet that allow
GNU GPL 2 and 3 simultaneously, then JSelfModify can simultaneously be multilicensed
GNU GPL 2 and 3, or if JSelfModify is combined only with Apache HttpCore (Apache 2 license),
then it can be licensed as Apache 2 and GPL 3 because GPL 3 is a subset of Apache 2.
JSelfModify is the "glue code" for the set of softwares called Human AI Net. Together,
their intersection is GNU GPL 3, but smaller subsets may have bigger license intersections.
Most parts of Human AI Net allow GNU GPL version 2 and higher if used in such a subset.
JSelfModify is more general than Human AI Net and is compatible with most licenses.

/** TODO rewrite all text to include User objects.
All commands will require a User object, which may be the root User object to allow anything.
If that User is not allowed to do that command, an Exception must be thrown.
If any user is allowed to do that command,
then its easy and efficient to not use the User parameter in the function body.
<br><br>
Mounts and trees of them are not synchronized,
and the quantity of childs (and which childs they are) in a Mount may change at any time.
<br><br>
TODO rewrite all this text because this software started in Audivolv and CodeSimian and is now called JSelfModify,
and because some parts of it are not included in JSelfModify because they were specific to Audivolv or CodeSimian.
Rewrite text...
<br><br>
In software talk, the word "mount" means to leave something at its original location
but make it appear to be in some other hierarchy, and for its existing subhierarchy (below it)
to be usable as a subhierarchy where it is mounted into the new hierarchy.
<br><br>
audivolv.Mount does not access your low-level file system like a normal mount command does.
<br><br>
All functions throw if anything fails.
Example: The del command in windows (with default options) often chooses not to delete a file
but gives no error message. That is bad design, and Audivolv must throw an error if x exists
after delete(x). If Audivolv's options say x should not be deleted, throw an error
because its an error to try to delete something that you are not allowed to delete.
<br><br>
Example: Audivolv should not be able to delete files that are not in a Mount,
and the Mount should only be put on files and dirs that the user allows Audivolv to use
(including the 1 dir created when Audivolv starts).
TODO Put audivolv.Mounts on other dirs and do not allow delete/modify,
as the "Privacy and Safety policy" says.
<br><br>
This Mount interface is similar to a Unix filesystem in these ways:
* Paths are separated by "/".
* Anything can be mounted to any path. Example: sound-card, hard-drive,
folders on the internet, the number of red pixels near the mouse on screen. Anything.
Of course, the more advanced mounts require writing code, which requires open-source.
<br><br>
Remember to check Audivolv's privacy-and-safety-policy before
writing code that implements Mount and connects to these data sources.
<br><br>
Example: mount the hard-drive folder c:/temp/music to /musicfiles
Example: mount the contents of this Audivolv*.jar to /jarfile/audivolv5
Example: mount http://fsf.org to /website/fsf.org and read from it (writing would fail)
<br><br>
This Mount interface has this unique feature:
* Text in the hierarchy names can use any of the 1.1 million
Unicode symbols (not just those on your keyboard), including the forward slash "/" delimiter.
Example: /sentences/"Â©an/you\r\n save \"a\" file here?"/"you can in audivolv.txt"
All files must be UTF-8 for this to work.
