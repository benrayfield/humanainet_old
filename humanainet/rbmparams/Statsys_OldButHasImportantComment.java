	//TODO create this Statsys interface as what my older statsys interface (designed for neuralnets and bayesnets) should have been but it got tangled with nsnode/localName system, and now that I've decided to use avlBitstring I can proceed in a consistent way. I need to quickly create an interface to measure benfrayfieldResearch.parametersToExploreWithContrastiveDivergence. What do I want it to do? I'll get lost in details if I dont define this first. Encapsulate the details of how the statsys works inside this interface, so we only see the visible nodes input and output and shortTermMemory here (which are part of visibleNodes, and at multiple layers but we dont know that, just how bit it is)."
