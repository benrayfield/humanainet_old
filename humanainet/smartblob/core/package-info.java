/** Core of Smartblob game and AI framework which PC and Android versions share, and maybe others later.
iOS has less inputLag than Android because of how threads are organized,
but iOS does not easily support Java so if there is an iPhone version it would be later.
PC has almost no inputLag in the mouse control to seeing it on screen.
Smartblob uses many fingers at once on Multitouchscreens and could have a 2 player per device mode
where people touch on opposite sides of the same screen, even in a massively multiplayer internet space.
Different devices (including PC and Android) will all play in the same internet space together.
Many people each with 1 mouse, or whatever game controller, can work together like a multitouch.
